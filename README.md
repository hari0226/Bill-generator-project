# Supermarket Billing System
# Objective
The Supermarket Billing System is a simple Python-based console application that simulates the process of purchasing items in a supermarket, calculating the total cost, applying GST (Goods and Services Tax), and generating a receipt. This project is designed to demonstrate basic concepts such as user input validation, price calculation, and receipt formatting.

# Features:
* Allows the user to input their name and purchase items.

* Validates user inputs (ensures items and quantities are correct).

* Calculates the total amount before tax, applies GST (5%), and computes the final amount.

* Prints a formatted receipt with the list of items, their quantities, prices, and taxes.

* Allows the user to finish the purchase by typing "done".

# Tools Used
# Programming Language:
* Python

# Libraries:
* datetime (for getting the current date and time)

# Key Features & Functions
# Input Validation
* Ensures the user inputs valid item names and quantities.

* Handles edge cases, such as invalid or negative numbers for quantities.

# Flexible Item Selection
* Displays available items with their prices and allows the user to select items to add to the cart.

* Users can specify the quantity of each item.

# Receipt Generation
1. After the user finishes selecting items, a detailed receipt is printed, showing:

* Purchased items with their quantities and prices.

* Total price of the items.

* GST applied (5%).

* Final amount to be paid after including the GST.

2. The receipt also includes the customer's name and the current date and time.

# Error Handling
* Provides clear error messages and asks for input again if the user enters invalid data (e.g., wrong item name or non-numeric input for quantity).
